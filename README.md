# Why? ü§∑‚Äç

This SPIKE project is meant for *us*
or anyone that is interested
in connecting a Flutter application
with a backend written in Elixir
and Phoenix.

We want to evaluate the implementation
details of how this process is
with *websockets connections*
between the two parties.

# What? üí≠

[`Flutter`](https://flutter.dev/)
is an open-source framework created by Google 
for creating multi-platform, 
high-performance applications from a single codebase. 
It makes it easier for you to build user interfaces 
that works both on web and mobile devices.
To learn more about `Flutter`,
we recommend you checking
[`dwyl/learn-flutter`](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-flutter)

[`Phoenix`](https://www.phoenixframework.org/)
is a web framework for the 
[`Elixir`](https://elixir-lang.org/)
programming language, 
perfect for soft-realtime communication 
with external clients through websockets.
To learn more about Phoenix and Elixir,
we suggest visiting
[`dwyl/learn-phoenix-framework`](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-phoenix-framework)
and
[`dwyl/learn-elixir`](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-elixir)

We will create a simple Flutter app
that will connect to a Phoenix-based backend server
and check who is currently online.

# Who? üë§

This quick demo is aimed at people in the @dwyl team
who need to understand how to communicate 
between `Flutter` apps and `Phoenix`-based servers.

# _How_? üë©‚Äçüíª

## Prerequisites? üìù

This demo assumes 
you have some basic knowledge of `Flutter`
and `Phoenix`.

We try to explain everything 
in a beginner-friendly way
but we also want to focus
on the implementation details
of communication between the app
and the `Phoenix` server.

Therefore, 
we recommend giving `learn` repositories
above a read before diving into this demo.
