# Why? ü§∑‚Äç

This SPIKE project is meant for *us*
or anyone that is interested
in connecting a `Flutter` application
with a backend written in `Elixir`
and `Phoenix`.

We want to evaluate the implementation
details of how this process is
with *websockets connections*
between the two parties.

# What? üí≠

[`Flutter`](https://flutter.dev/)
is an open-source framework created by Google 
for creating multi-platform, 
high-performance applications from a single codebase. 
It makes it easier to build Apps
that work on web and mobile devices.
To learn more about `Flutter`,
we recommend you checking
[`dwyl/learn-flutter`](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-flutter)

[`Phoenix`](https://www.phoenixframework.org/)
is a web framework for the 
[`Elixir`](https://elixir-lang.org/)
programming language, 
perfect for soft-realtime communication 
with external clients through `WebSockets`.
To learn more about `Phoenix` and `Elixir`,
we suggest visiting
[`dwyl/learn-phoenix-framework`](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-phoenix-framework)
and
[`dwyl/learn-elixir`](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-elixir).

We will create a simple `Flutter` app
that will connect to a `Phoenix` backend server
and check who is currently online.

# Who? üë§

This quick demo is aimed at people in the @dwyl team
who need to understand how to communicate 
between `Flutter` apps and `Phoenix` servers.

# _How_? üë©‚Äçüíª

## Prerequisites? üìù

This demo assumes 
you have some basic knowledge of `Flutter`
and `Phoenix`.

We try to explain everything 
in a beginner-friendly way
but we also want to focus
on the implementation details
of communication between the app
and the `Phoenix` server.

Therefore, 
we recommend giving the `learn` repositories
linked above a read before diving into this demo.

Throughout this tutorial,
you will be basically developing
both the **frontend** and the **backend**.
We *recommend* having separate terminal windows
(or Visual Studio windows)
for each one, 
as you will be running 
the `Phoenix` backend on one
and the `Flutter` client app
on the other.

## I want to run this project! üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

You might have noticed we have two folders:
- [`app`](./app/), 
pertaining to the `Flutter` application.
- [`backend`](./backend/),
pertaining to the `Phoenix` server
that the client `Flutter` app will connect to.

We recommend you opening *two* 
different terminal windows
(one for each folder).
Then open the `README.md` file 
in each of these folders
and follow the instructions
to run the project
and see it in action!

<br />

## 0. Creating basic `Flutter` app

In this section, 
we will be creating 
both the **client** (`Flutter`)
and the **backend** (`Phoenix`).

### 0.1 Creating new `Flutter` app

In the directory of your project,
create a new directory called `app`.
This is where the `Flutter` app will reside in.

```sh
mkdir app
cd app
```

We are going to start this from scratch.
To create a new `Flutter` project
with Visual Studio,
please follow the instructions
in 
[dwyl/learn-flutter#0-setting-up-a-new-project](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-flutter#0-setting-up-a-new-project)
(you only need to read the 
**0. Setting up a new project** section).

After creating all the files
and running `flutter pub get`
to fetch all the dependencies,
we are ready to run the app
to test it.

To start the application 
on an emulator,
please visit the link above,.

On the other hand,
if you want to run the app
on a real device,
check 
[dwyl/flutter-stopwatch-tutorial#running-on-a-real-device](https://github.com/dwyl/flutter-stopwatch-tutorial/tree/33907b1b01760dd49db85fa97fb84ce4562252ae#running-on-a-real-device)
to get started
and read the **Running on a real device** section.

You should now have a 
simple working counter app.

![starter_app](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17494745/200814531-31579684-e6ec-4da4-a504-642eb31fedb9.png)

### 0.2 Creating new `Phoenix` server

Let's now create a brand new `Phoenix`
server so our `Flutter` app can connect to.
In the project root, 
create a new folder called `backend`
and enter it.

```sh
cd ..
mkdir backend
cd backend
```

In here, 
run the following command 
to bootstrap a new `Phoenix` project.

```sh
mix phx.new . --app app --no-ecto --no-html --no-gettext --no-dashboard --no-mailer
```

> We are creating a `Phoenix` server
> without any views, dashboards, mail services
> or databases.
> We want a simple, lightweight server
> to create 
> [channels](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/channels.html)
> where people will join and leave.

After executing this command,
when prompted to install the dependencies,
enter `Y` to download and install them.

After installing,
simply run `mix phx.server`,
and you should see your server running!

## 1. Creating a room in `Phoenix`

In `Phoenix`,
let's start by creating a 
channel/room for people to join in.

For this, 
inside the `backend` directory,
where your `Phoenix` project resides,
stop the server (in case you are running it)
and run:

```elixir
mix phx.gen.channel Room
```

Your terminal should yield the following output.

```sh
* creating lib/app_web/channels/room_channel.ex
* creating test/app_web/channels/room_channel_test.exs
* creating test/support/channel_case.ex

The default socket handler - AppWeb.UserSocket - was not found.
Do you want to create it? [Yn]
```

Type `Y` and press `Enter`.
This will create a **user socket handler** for us.
The terminal should now state:

```sh
* creating lib/app_web/channels/user_socket.ex
* creating assets/js/user_socket.js

Add the socket handler to your `lib/app_web/endpoint.ex`, for example:

    socket "/socket", AppWeb.UserSocket,
      websocket: true,
      longpoll: false

For the front-end integration, you need to import the `user_socket.js`
in your `assets/js/app.js` file:

    import "./user_socket.js"
```

Let's follow the first instructions
and add the snippet of code to `endpoint.ex`.
Open `lib/app_web/endpoint.ex` and add:

```elixir
    socket "/socket", AppWeb.UserSocket,
      websocket: true,
      longpoll: false
```

And we're done! üéâ
We've successfully created a 
channel/room that people can join in.
We will be able to do whatever we want
and handle different events
inside `lib/app_web/channels/room_channel.ex`
that we've just now created. 

## 2. Setting up `Flutter` page

Let's go back to `Flutter`.

As it stands, 
we don't want a *counter app*.
We want a simple page
allowing the person to connect
to the room 
and see who's also online.

We want the person to type a username,
connect 
and see the current people.

Let's create a screen for this.
Inside `lib/main.dart`,
locate `_MyHomePageState` class
change it so it looks like the following.

```dart
class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  bool connected = false;
  String _username = "";

  onButtonPress() {
    if (_username.isNotEmpty) {
    } else {
      return null;
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text(widget.title),
      ),
      body: Column(
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.start,
        children: <Widget>[
          Container(
            child: Padding(
                padding: const EdgeInsets.only(bottom: 32, left: 16, right: 16),
                child: Row(
                  crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.end,
                  children: [
                    Expanded(
                        child: TextFormField(
                      onChanged: (value) => setState(() {
                        _username = value;
                      }),
                      decoration: const InputDecoration(
                        border: UnderlineInputBorder(),
                        labelText: 'Enter your username',
                      ),
                    )),
                    Padding(
                      padding: const EdgeInsets.only(left: 16),
                      child: ElevatedButton(
                        onPressed: _username.isEmpty ? null : onButtonPress,
                        child: const Text('Connect'),
                      ),
                    )
                  ],
                )),
          ),
          Padding(
              padding: const EdgeInsets.only(bottom: 32),
              child: connected
                  ? const Text(
                      'Connected',
                      style: TextStyle(fontWeight: FontWeight.bold, color: Color.fromARGB(238, 56, 231, 94)),
                    )
                  : const Text(
                      'Disconnected',
                      style: TextStyle(fontWeight: FontWeight.bold, color: Color.fromARGB(239, 255, 48, 48)),
                    )),
          Expanded(
            child: ListView(
              children: <Widget>[
                Container(
                  height: 50,
                  color: Colors.amber[600],
                  child: const Center(child: Text('Entry A')),
                ),
                Container(
                  height: 50,
                  color: Colors.amber[500],
                  child: const Center(child: Text('Entry B')),
                ),
                Container(
                  height: 50,
                  color: Colors.amber[100],
                  child: const Center(child: Text('Entry C')),
                ),
              ],
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Additionally, 
locate the `MyApp` class
and change the title, like so.

```dart
      home: const MyHomePage(title: 'Who\'s online?'),
```

We've created a simple page
with a `ListView`
that will show the list of people connected.
For now, 
we are just adding `Container`s
with sample data.

The button to connect
should be disabled
if the username is empty.

Connection status is shown 
with a `Textfield` 
informing the person if he/she is connected or not.

Both the `username` and `connection` status
are part of the state of the page,
which will dynamically change
according to the person actions
(changing the username
and connection to the Phoenix
channel, respectively).

When the button is pressed,
the `onButtonPress()` callback function
is called.
For now, it doesn't do anything.
But will later connect to the Phoenix server.

The app should have the following layout.

![basic_layout](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17494745/217049291-d5ccbe95-16e9-4f83-b2fe-c930b6cee9a8.png)

## 3. Tracking people in `Phoenix` server

As it stands, `Phoenix`
doesn't really have a way of knowing 
*which* and *how many* people/processes
are connected to the channel.

Tracking these processes is necessary
to know *who is online*
so we can display the username to the person in `Flutter`.

Luckily for us, `Phoenix`
has a module called 
[**`Presence`**](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.Presence.html)
that makes is easy to track processes and channels.

This behaviour module makes it possible
to handle differences of "join" and "leave" events
*in real-time*.

Let's add `Presence` to our `Phoenix` server.
Create a file called `presence.ex`
in `lib/app_web`
and paste the following code.

```elixir
defmodule AppWeb.Presence do
  use Phoenix.Presence,
    otp_app: :app,
    pubsub_server: App.PubSub
end
```

We are defining a presence module
within our application
and providing the `:otp_app`
with the `:app` configuration
that is defined in `mix.exs`,
as well as `pubsub_server`,
which exists by default in `Phoenix` applications.

Next, let's add a new 
[**supervisor**](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/mix-otp/supervisor-and-application.html#our-first-supervisor)
to the the supervision tree
in `lib/app/application.ex`.

> **Warning** It **must** be added *after*
> the `PubSub` child and *before* the endpoint.

```elixir
    children = [
    # Start the Telemetry supervisor
    AppWeb.Telemetry,
    # Start the PubSub system
    {Phoenix.PubSub, name: App.PubSub},
    # Start the Endpoint (http/https)
    AppWeb.Presence,
    AppWeb.Endpoint
    # Start a worker by calling: App.Worker.start_link(arg)
    # {App.Worker, arg}
  ]
```

And that's it!
We've just *configured* `Presence`.
Now it's time to *use it*!

### 3.1 Tracking people 

For each process 
we are going to be tracking with `Presence`, 
we want to add **metadata** 
to show in the `Flutter` client.

One of these is the **`user_id`**.
For this, we will use 
[`UUID`](https://hexdocs.pm/uuid/readme.html),
a library that generates unique 
[UUIDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier).

To install it,
add the following line 
in the `deps` section in `mix.exs`.

```elixir
{:uuid, "~> 1.1" }
```

And run `mix deps.get` to fetch the dependencies.

After installing this,
change `lib/app_web/channels/room_channel.ex`
to the following code.

```elixir
defmodule AppWeb.RoomChannel do
  use AppWeb, :channel
  alias AppWeb.Presence

  @impl true
  def join("room:lobby", payload, socket) do
    username = Map.get(payload, "username", "")
    user_id = UUID.uuid1()

    send(self(), :after_join)
    {:ok, assign(socket, %{username: username, user_id: user_id})}
  end

  @impl true
  def handle_info(:after_join, socket) do
    {:ok, _} = Presence.track(socket, socket.assigns.user_id, %{
      username: socket.assigns.username,
      online_at: inspect(System.system_time(:millisecond))
    })

    push(socket, "presence_state", Presence.list(socket))
    {:noreply, socket}
  end
end
```

Let's break it down. üß±

Inside the `join/3` function
(that is called whenever a person joins the channel),
we get the username of the person
that is passed through the parameters
and generate an UUID for the person.
We assign *both of these to the socket assigns*.

Inside this function,
the person is deferred to `:after_join`,
which is handled in 
`handle_info(:after_join, socket)`.

In this function,
we *track the process* by calling
`Presence.track/3`,
where we add metadata (username and time it was online)
to the process with the UUID we created prior.

We then *push* this 
presence information
to the client
as a `"presence_state"` event.

This metadata will be shown
in the `Flutter` client app.

And that's it! üëè
The only thing that's left 
is to connect the `Flutter` app
to our `Phoenix` server
and communicate with it!

## 4. Connect `Flutter` to `Phoenix`

Let's finish this.

To communicate with our `Phoenix` app,
we need to install a library 
called 
[`phoenix_socket`](https://pub.dev/packages/phoenix_socket).
To install it, add the following line
to `pubspec.yaml`
in the `dependencies` section.

```yaml
phoenix_socket: ^0.6.2
```

And run `flutter pub get`
to fetch the dependency.

Then, head over to `app/lib/main.dart`
and change it to the following code.
Don't worry, 
we'll explain each step.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:phoenix_socket/phoenix_socket.dart';

const socketURL = String.fromEnvironment('SERVER_URL', defaultValue: 'ws://localhost:4000/socket/websocket');
const channelName = String.fromEnvironment('CHANNEL_NAME', defaultValue: 'room:lobby');

void main() {
  runApp(const MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});

  // This widget is the root of your application.
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: const MyHomePage(title: 'Who\'s online?'),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  const MyHomePage({super.key, required this.title});

  final String title;

  @override
  State<MyHomePage> createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  bool _connected = false;
  String _username = "";
  late PhoenixSocket _socket;
  late PhoenixChannel _channel;
  late PhoenixPresence _presence;

  var _responses = [];

  onButtonPress() {
    // If the user is not connected, create the socket and configure it

    if (!_connected) {
      // Connect socket and adding event handlers
      _socket = PhoenixSocket(socketURL)..connect();

      // If stream is closed
      _socket.closeStream.listen((event) {
        _socket.close();
        setState(() {
          _connected = false;
          _responses = [];
        });
      });

      // If stream is open, join channel with username as param
      _socket.openStream.listen((event) {
        setState(() {
          _channel = _socket.addChannel(topic: channelName, parameters: {"username": _username})..join(const Duration(seconds: 1));
          _connected = true;
        });

        _presence = PhoenixPresence(channel: _channel);
        // https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/presence.html#the-presence-generator
        // listens to `presence_state` and `presence_diff`
        // events that go through `onSync` callback, forcing re-render
        _presence.onSync = () {
          var updatedResponses = _presence.list(_presence.state, (String id, Presence presence) {
            final metaObj = presence.metas.first.data;
            return {"user_id": id, "username": metaObj["username"]};
          });

          setState(() {
            _responses = updatedResponses;
          });
        };
      });
    } else {
      _socket.close();
      setState(() {
        _responses = [];
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text(widget.title),
      ),

                  ? const Text(
                      'Connected',
                      style: TextStyle(fontWeight: FontWeight.bold, color: Color.fromARGB(238, 56, 231, 94)),
                    )
                  : const Text(
                      'Disconnected',
                      style: TextStyle(fontWeight: FontWeight.bold, color: Color.fromARGB(239, 255, 48, 48)),

                      height: 50,
                      child: Center(child: Text(_responses[index]["username"])),
                    );
                  })),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

e.g
[`app/lib/main.dart`](https://github.com/dwyl/flutter-phoenix-channels-demo/pull/2/commits/fa7eeb32f0c261fb53c729199b13ecfdb1ef3628#diff-43a41aed8f4bf51ecb85660250a9e01f6b783178ba5d5317606bda12467ddb82)

### 4.1 `_connected_` and `_username` fields

We import the package like so.

```dart
import 'package:phoenix_socket/phoenix_socket.dart';
```

We want the person to connect
to the channel after pressing the button.
The person **must have an username**
to connect to the server.

Hence why the button is only enabled
whenever the `_username` field
(which is managed by `TextField`)
is not empty.

Therefore, we have two fields
`_connected` and `_username`
that change according 
to the status of the connection
and as the person is typing in the `Textfield`,
respectively.

```dart
Padding(
    padding: const EdgeInsets.only(bottom: 32, left: 16, right: 16),
    child: Row(
      crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.end,
      children: [
        Expanded(
            child: TextFormField(
          onChanged: (value) => setState(() {
            _username = value;                // changing the value in each keystroke
          }),
          decoration: const InputDecoration(
            border: UnderlineInputBorder(),
            labelText: 'Enter your username',
          ),
        )),
        Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.only(left: 16),
          child: ElevatedButton(
            style: ElevatedButton.styleFrom(
                backgroundColor: _connected ? const Color.fromARGB(255, 215, 75, 75) : const Color.fromARGB(255, 95, 143, 77)),
            onPressed: _username.isEmpty ? null : onButtonPress,        // disable according to status connection
            child: _connected ? const Text('Disconnect') : const Text('Connect'),         // change text according to the connection status
          ),
        )
      ],
    )),
```

### 4.2 Connecting to `Phoenix` server when pressing the button

The `onButtonPress` function,
as the name entails,
implements the logic of connecting
`Flutter` to our `Phoenix` server
whenever the user presses the button.

```dart
  onButtonPress() {
    // If the user is not connected, create the socket and configure it

    if (!_connected) {
      // Connect socket and adding event handlers
      _socket = PhoenixSocket(socketURL)..connect();

      // If stream is closed
      _socket.closeStream.listen((event) {
        _socket.close();
        setState(() {
          _connected = false;
          _responses = [];
        });
      });

      // If stream is open, join channel with username as param
      _socket.openStream.listen((event) {
        setState(() {
          _channel = _socket.addChannel(topic: channelName, parameters: {"username": _username})..join(const Duration(seconds: 1));
          _connected = true;
        });

        _presence = PhoenixPresence(channel: _channel);
        // https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/presence.html#the-presence-generator
        // listens to `presence_state` and `presence_diff`
        // events that go through `onSync` callback, forcing re-render
        _presence.onSync = () {
          var updatedResponses = _presence.list(_presence.state, (String id, Presence presence) {
            final metaObj = presence.metas.first.data;
            return {"user_id": id, "username": metaObj["username"]};
          });

          setState(() {
            _responses = updatedResponses;
          });
        };
      });
    } else {
      _socket.close();
      setState(() {
        _responses = [];
      });
    }
  }

```

In this function 
we initialize four fields:
- `_socket`, pertaining to the socket connection.
- `_channel`, pertaining to the channel the person is joining.
- `_presence`, an object with the `Presence` information
of the given channel.
- `responses`, a list of users currently connected
to the channel.
The reason it's named `responses` instead of `users`
is so you know it's a `diff` response from the presence server
that is *parsed* into a list of connected users.

This function first verifies
if the person is already connected or not.
If he/she is, 
it means the person wants to disconnect
and we close the socket connection
and reset the `responses` person array to an empty array.

On the other hand,
if it's not connected,
we try to do so.

We first connect the socket
to the `ws://localhost:4000/socket/websocket` URL
(this assumes you are running the `Phoenix` server on `localhost`)
and add the handlers
for both *open* and *closed* connection.
The connection is made to `localhost` by default
if the `SERVER_URL` 
[env variable](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-environment-variables) 
is not defined.

- If the stream is **closed**,
we close the socket connection
and set `_connected` to `false`
to show the appropriate feedback.
- Otherwise, if the stream is **open**,
it means the person is **connected**.
We join the channel
and send the `_username` as parameters
to the `Phoenix` server.
Additionally, 
we add an `onSync` callback
to *receive presence information*
whenever there are any "leave" or "join" events
to the channel. 
We use this information to update the list
of connected users that is shown on the app.

### 4.3 Listing the users

All there's left is to show the username
of the users that are connected to the `Phoenix` server.

We currently have placeholder items.
Let's change it to show 
the contents of `_responses`.

Inside the `build` function 
of `_MyHomePageState`,
locate the `Expanded` widget
and replace it with the following.

```dart
Expanded(
  child: ListView.separated(
      padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8),
      itemCount: _responses.length,
      separatorBuilder: (BuildContext context, int index) => const Divider(),
      itemBuilder: (BuildContext context, int index) {
        return SizedBox(
          height: 50,
          child: Center(child: Text(_responses[index]["username"])),
        );
      })),
```

We are simply iterating over 
`_responses` 
and creating a `SizedBox` 
with a fixed height
with the username of the connected person.

As seen earlier, 
`_connected` is updated
everytime there is an update
on the presence info from the `Phoenix` server.
So we know the list properly shows
the connected users efficiently and correctly.

## 5. Run the app! 

Checking if everything is properly working
is best done with two different emulators/devices.
Choose the device in Visual Studio Code
and click on `Run > Start debugging`.
Do this for *two different devices*,
so we emulate two different users connecting to the server.

In the gif below,
we are checking a *Chrome* page and *iOS* device.

![final](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17494745/217349562-61d84244-67cf-49f0-a77b-373b10520858.gif)

Awesome! üéâ

We now have two devices
communicating with our `Phoenix` server
**in real-time**.

We've gone over using the `Presence`
module on both `Phoenix` and `Flutter`.
But you don't need to if you just want to 
exchange simple messages 
or just want to push simple messages to the socket!

As you can see, 
it is *easy* to get a real-time app working in `Flutter`!

## 6. *Bonus points*: Adding splash screen

If you start the application
and run [`Lighthouse`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/)
(a tool that audits your web page and provides 
hints on how to improve the quality and speed;
it's embedded by default in Chrome browsers),
you may see the following result.

<img width="1063" alt="before_lighouse" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17494745/221198967-ad210c1e-d231-4ba9-adc0-9dc8760e6722.png">

This is *not good news*,
especially if you're looking for a good SEO rank.

`Flutter Web`'s initial loading times 
has been thoroughly discussed
e.g: 
[flutter/issues/76009](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/76009)
amongst the Flutter community,
as it can be considered *slow* in production
when compared with other websites.

The reason for this 
is because `Flutter` on the *web*
has an initialization process, 
consisting of: 
- fetching the `main.dart.js` script 
and initializing the service worker.
- initializing/downloading Flutter's web engine.
- preparing 
[the DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction)
for the Flutter app to run.

This process can take a few seconds,
which is *not desirable*.

However,
we can **improve `Lighthouse` metrics**
by adding a splash screen,
letting the `person` know this initialization process
is occurring,
instead of just showing a blank screen.

Luckily for us, 
we can leverage 
the `_flutter.loader.loadEntrypoint` callback functions
inside `web/index.html`
to customize the splash screen 
and the progress.

Head over to `web/index.html`,
and locate the `<body>` of the file.
You should find something like the snippet of code below.

```html
<body>

  <script>
    window.addEventListener('load', function(ev) {

        // Download main.dart.js
      _flutter.loader.loadEntrypoint({
        serviceWorker: {
          serviceWorkerVersion: serviceWorkerVersion,
        }
      }).then(function(engineInitializer) {
        return engineInitializer.initializeEngine();
      }).then(function(appRunner) {
        return appRunner.runApp();
      });
    });
  </script>
</body>
```

Change it to the following.

```html
<body>
  <div id="loading">
    <style>
      body {
        inset: 0;
        overflow: hidden;
        margin: 0;
        padding: 0;
        position: fixed;
      }

      #loading {
        align-items: center;
        display: flex;
        flex-direction: column;
        height: 50%;
        justify-content: center;
        width: 50%;
      }

      #loading span {
        color: #111; 
        font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; 
        font-size: 30px; 
        font-weight: 300; 
        line-height: 32px;
        margin: 0 0 72px; 
        text-align: center; 
      }

      #loading img {
        animation: 1s ease-in-out 0s infinite alternate breathe;
        opacity: .66;
        transition: opacity .4s;
      }

      #loading.main_done img {
        opacity: 1;
      }

      #loading.init_done img {
        animation: .33s ease-in-out 0s 1 forwards zooooom;
        opacity: .05;
      }

      @keyframes breathe {
        from {
          transform: scale(1)
        }

        to {
          transform: scale(0.95)
        }
      }

      @keyframes zooooom {
        from {
          transform: scale(1)
        }

        to {
          transform: scale(10)
        }
      }
    </style>
    <img src="icons/Icon-192.png" alt="Loading indicator..." />
    <span id="loading-text">Let's go!</span>
  </div>
  <script>
    window.addEventListener('load', function(ev) {

      // Showing loading indicator
      var loading = document.querySelector('#loading');
      var loadingText = document.querySelector('#loading-text');
      loadingText.textContent = "Loading ...";

      // Download main.dart.js
      _flutter.loader.loadEntrypoint({
        serviceWorker: {
          serviceWorkerVersion: serviceWorkerVersion,
        },
        onEntrypointLoaded: async function(engineInitializer) {
          loadingText.textContent = "Initializing engine ...";
          
          let appRunner = await engineInitializer.initializeEngine();

          loading.style.display = 'none';
          await appRunner.runApp();
        }
      });
    });
  </script>
</body>
```

We've added a simple `<div>` element
with `id="loading"` 
with sample text inside.
Inside this element we will show
**an image** and a **text** that will change
according to the different stage of the initialization process.

If you run the web application again,
you should see something like this:

![final](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17494745/221218715-29e10501-0748-4ab0-9ea7-ce57eb6c5cec.gif)

Looks a bit better, doesn't it?

Let's see how the `Lighthouse` metrics are improved:


<img width="1206" alt="improved_lighthouse" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17494745/221225710-0ee26cb3-da6f-4dfd-93ac-bc3618dd7a46.png">

> These `Lighthouse` metrics are being performed
> on the **deployed version** in `Fly.io`,
> *not* on `localhost`. 
> This is to get more reliable results on a *real-world scenario*.
>
> If you aren't sure how to create a release bundle
> and deploy to `Fly.io`,
> please refer to the [Deployment üì¶](#deployment-) section.


We've scored a 96 on performance!
That's awesome! ü§©

## 6.1 Switching between the `html` and `canvaskit` web renderers

As we've mentioned prior, 
when running `flutter build web`,
the default behaviour is using a
`canvaskit` 
[web renderer](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/platform-integration/web/renderers)
on *desktop devices*
and `html` on *mobile devices*.

Let's explore how the metrics would be affected
if we were to override the web renderer
with **`html` on web devices**.

We can do this programatically
(just to make sure we're actually switching renderers)
in the 
[`initializeEngine`](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/platform-integration/web/initialization) method
by passing arguments.

> **Note**:
> We don't need to do this programatically.
> When we run `flutter build web --web-renderer html`
> this setting is overridden for you 
> **without** having to tinker with any code or settings.
>
> You can find more information if you run
> `flutter build web --help`.

Inside `web/index.html`, 
locate the `<body>` and the
`<script>` that initializes the Flutter engine
(the same one we changed before).

Change the `_flutter.loader` method
to the following piece of code.

```js
    _flutter.loader.loadEntrypoint({
      serviceWorker: {
        serviceWorkerVersion: serviceWorkerVersion,
      },
      onEntrypointLoaded: async function(engineInitializer) {
        loadingText.textContent = "Initializing engine...";
        const renderer = "canvaskit"
        console.log(renderer)
        
        let appRunner = await engineInitializer.initializeEngine({"renderer": renderer});

        loading.style.display = 'none';
        await appRunner.runApp();
      }
    });
```

Here we are overriding the **web renderer** with **`canvaskit`**.
Yes, it won't change anything because it's the default behaviour.
We just want to see it printing to the console
so we are sure the renderer is different when we check!

Run the app
and check the console!

<img width="935" alt="canvaskit" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17494745/221229347-1a52d21b-20e6-47df-8295-a5efb72de6b8.png">

Awesome!
We know for sure `canvaskit` is being used.
If we build and deploy this to `fly.io`,
we will get the following results.

<img width="1039" alt="canvas_kit_results" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17494745/221231043-f3bd000c-86b0-4056-8ddf-d95b79bf0d41.png">

Exactly what we expected,
as this was the default behaviour.

**But now, let's change to `html`**.

Change the `const renderer = "canvaskit"`
in the previous code snippet to
`const renderer = "html"`.

Let's build this and run it.

<img width="670" alt="html" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17494745/221231510-e34a451a-9add-4091-84d3-dba547cba7d4.png">

Ok, now we got `html` being passed as the web renderer.
Let's build this and deploy to `Fly.io`
and run `Lighthouse`.

<img width="1096" alt="html_results" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17494745/221233328-d3978570-4473-4fc1-9181-923bbd7ddee8.png">

We actually see a performance improvement!
From `96` to `99`, in fact!
Not too shabby! ‚ö°Ô∏è


## 6.2 Which web renderer should I choose?

As always, the answer is: 
*it depends*.
Here's a good resource to read that has
an in-depth comparison between the two options: 
https://geekyants.com/blog/web-renderers-which-one-to-choose-html-or-canvaskit/.

If you want a [`tl;dr`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TL;DR#:~:text=TL%3BDR%20or%20tl%3Bdr,Oxford%20Dictionaries%20Online%20in%202013.),
and quoting the article:

> Choose the `html` option 
> if you are optimizing download size over 
> performance on both desktop and mobile browsers.

> Choose the `canvaskit` option 
> if you are prioritizing performance 
> and pixel-perfect consistency 
> on both desktop and mobile browsers.


# Deployment üì¶

If you are keen on deploying both of these applications online,
in each folder we have created a `fly.toml` file
that can be used to deploy both applications
to [fly.io](https://fly.io/dashboard).

You need to create an account
and install the the command-line interface
[`flyctl`](https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/install-flyctl/) 
to make use of these `fly.toml` files 
and easily deploy both apps.

You can find more information 
on how to deploy both applications
in their respective folders.


# Enhancing the `PWA`

Since we've used `Flutter`,
we can leverage its capabilities to deploy it
to iOS, Android and Web devices.

For the latter, 
when creating the **release bundle**,
the person is able to download a [`PWA`](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/) 
(Progressive Web App).

We can *enhance its capabilities*
and make it better and prettier!
By default, any `Flutter` app 
has `PWA` capabilities built-in.
It's our job, as developers,
to *extend them* 
and make the experience for our `people` **better**!

We've created a guide with this in mind in
[`./app/pwa.md`](./app/pwa.md)
that you can follow 
and enhance the `Flutter` app 
to make it awesome-er!
