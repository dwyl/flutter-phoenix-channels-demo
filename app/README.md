# `Flutter` application

Welcome to the `Flutter` client app!

This app will *connect*
to a `Phoenix` server.
You need to run it first
in the [`./backend`](../backend/)
folder.

# Pre-requisites 📝

To run Flutter,
whether it's on a real device
or on an emulator,
you need to have the 
**`Flutter SDK`** installed, 
along with `XCode`
and `Android Studio`.

This process can take some time.
Therefore, we've already created a guide for you
to help you get through it
and start "fluttering" 🦋
ASAP!
