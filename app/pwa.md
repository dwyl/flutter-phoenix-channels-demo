# Enhancing our `PWA` 👩‍💻 

This is a small guide
that will guide you 
to deploy enhance the `Flutter` app,
making it a *better* `PWA` for selected platforms,
and provide the user with a better experience!

# Checking the current `PWA` of the app

After you've deployed your application to the web,
you will be able to download it as a `PWA`.

If you want to check this out,
you can check deployed app in
https://flutter-phoenix-channels-frontend.fly.dev/.

To install the `PWA`,
you need to click on the icon 
in the URL bar, 
as detailed below.

If you click on `Install`,
you will notice that
(assuming you're using Google Chrome),
the app will be installed 
as a `"Chrome App"`.

And now the app is accessible
as it was a *native application*.
It has its own window.

And can be accessed as it was a normal app
in your computer.

*However*,
it's using `Flutter`'s default configurations.
It doesn't have a custom image,
its own app name and it's missing some information.
**This is what we are going to be addressing in this guide**.

Let's do it together! 🤝
